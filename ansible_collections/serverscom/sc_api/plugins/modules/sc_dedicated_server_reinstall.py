module: sc_dedicated_server_reinstall
version_added: "1.0.0"
author: "George Shuklin (@amarao)"
short_description: Reinstall baremetal server.
description: >
    Reinstall the existing baremetal server. Existing data may be lost in
    the process. No secure erase or wipe is performed during installation.
    Some data may be preserved.
    Reinstallation request may fail for servers with custom hardware
    configuration (external drive shelves).

    drives_layout_template:
        type: str
        choices: [raid1-simple, raid0-simple]
        description:
            - Mutually exclusive with I(drives_layout).
            - Provides a template to use instead of I(drives_layout).
            - C(raid1-simple) uses two first drives to create RAID1,
              partition /boot (1Gb), swap (4Gb) and / (all other space).
            - C(raid0-simple) uses first drive as raid0 (or no raid in case
              of servers without hardware raid), and places /boot, swap
              and / on this drive.
            - This option is implemented by this module (it generates layout
              for drives['layout'] request to API based on built-in template).

    drives_layout:
      type: list
      elements: dict
      description:
        - Partitioning schema for drives during reinstallation.
        - Mutually exclusive with I(drives_layout_template).

        - At least one layout should be provided.

        - Partitioning should provide at least '/' (root) and /boot (for Linux)
          or 'C:\' for Windows. Only paritioning for dirve 'C:\' is supported
          for Windows.

          required: true
          type: list
          elements: int
          description:
           - List of drive slots to use.
           - Count starts from slot 0.
           - Every slot may be used only once in one configration element.
           - Slot count is limited by number of physiscally availble drives
             in server.
        raid:
          type: int
          choices: [0, 1, 5, 6, 10, 50, 60]
          default: 0
          description:

            - Every raid type (except C(0)) have own requirement for
              number of used drives in I(slot_positions).
            - If raid is None (not specified), raid0 is built.
            - If I(slots_positions) has only one device, it will be used
              as a device or as a raid0 with a single drive depending on
              hadrware raid capabilities. Systems with software raid will
              use drive 'as is'.

        partitions:

          description:
              - Partition layout for raid or device.
              - Paritioning will be skipped if not specified ('ignore' in API).
              - Old data may be left if no partitioning was performed.

              size:
                type: int
                description:
                  - Size of partition in Mb
                  - Value of 0 is used to indicate 'fill mode'
                    (use all available space except for other partitions).
                  - Only one 'fill mode' partiiton may be present

        default: 86400
        description:
            - Time to wait for server to change status to 'ready'
            - If wait is 0 or absent, task is succeeded
              sending reuest to API without waiting.
            - When server become 'ready' after reinstallation,
              it can still be in booting state for some time
              and do not answer ssh/ping request.
              Use M(serverscom.sc_api.wait_for_connection) module
              to wait the server to become available though ssh.
            - Installation may start few minutes later than request,
              during this time server is responding with 'old' ssh.

    update_interval:
        type: int
        default: 60
        description:
            - Interval in seconds for requests for server status.
            - Each update request reduces number of available API
              requests in accordance with ratelimit.
            - Minimal value is 10.
            - Ignored if I(wait)=C(0).
