module: sc_cloud_computing_instance_state
version_added: "1.0.0"
author: "George Shuklin (@amarao)"
short_description: Manage instance states
description: >
    Allow to control power state and rescue mode for instance.
    This module does not allow removal and creation of the instance,
    use M(serverscom.sc_api.sc_cloud_computing_instance)
    with I(state)=Q(present)/Q(absent).

options:
    endpoint:
      type: str
      default: https://api.servers.com/v1
      description:
        - Endpoint to use to connect to API.
        - Do not change until specifically asked to do otherwise.

    token:
      type: str
      required: true
      description:
        - Token to use.
        - You can create token for you account in https://portal.servers.com
          in Profile -> Public API section.

    state:
      type: str
      required: true
      choices: ['shutdown', 'rescue', 'normal', 'rebooted']
      description:
        - Make sure instance in I(state) mode.
        - Module will fail if operation is impossible (f.e. migrating)
          or absent.
        - C(shutdown) shutdown instance.
        - C(rescue) reboot instance in rescue mode.
        - C(normal) turn instanse on or exit in rescue mode.
        - C(rebooted) reboot instance. This state cause non non-idempotent
          action.

    name:
      type: str
      aliases: [instance_name]
      description:
        - Name of the instance to set PTR records for.
        - If more than one server with a given name found, module will fail.
        - Use I(instance_id) for precise identification.
        - Mutually exclusive with I(instance_id).

    instance_id:
      type: str
      description:
        - Id of the instance to manage PTR records for.
        - Mutually exclusive with I(name).

    region_id:
      type: int
      description:
        - Region ID to search instance by name.
        - All regions are searched if not specified.
        - Used only if I(name) present.

    image_id:
      type: str
      description:
        - Image id to use for I(state)=C(rescue)
        - Mutually exclusive with I(image_regexp)
        - Original instance image will be used if I(image_id) and
          I(image_regexp) are not specified.

    image_regexp:
      type: str
      description:
        - Regular expression to search image by name to use
          for I(state)=C(rescue).
        - Original instance image will be used if I(image_id) and
          I(image_regexp) are not specified.
        - Mutually exclusive with I(image_id).
        - First matching image is used.

    wait:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 600
      description:
        - Time to wait until instance get to the desired state.
        - I(state)=C(shutdown) waits for SWITCHED_OFF.
        - I(state)=C(rescue) waits for RESCUE.
        - I(state)=C(normal) waits for ACTIVE.
        - I(state)=C(rebooted) waits for ACTIVE.
        - Value C(0) is used to disable wait.
        - If C(0) is set, module works in 'fire-and-forget' mode.
        - ACTIVE state doesn't mean that instance is ready to accept ssh
          connections. Use M(ansible.builtin.wait_for_connection) module
          wait until instance finishes booting.
          handlers or when statement may be used to preserve idempotency.

    update_interval:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 5
      description:
        - Polling interval for waiting.
        - Every polling request is reducing API ratelimits.
